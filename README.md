## Tips for Success

1. **Run cells in order** - Later cells depend on earlier ones
2. **Read error messages** - They tell you what went wrong!
3. **Experiment** - Modify examples to see what happens
4. **Use test cells** - They help you check your work
5. **Ask for help** - When stuck, reach out!

## Troubleshooting

**"Name not defined" error?**
- Run the cells above in order
- Make sure you defined the variable

**Import errors?**
- Restart the runtime: Runtime → Restart runtime
- Re-run cells from the top

**Colab disconnected?**
- Your work is saved automatically
- Just refresh and continue

**Lost your progress?**
- Check your Google Drive (Colab Notebooks folder)
- Your last save is there!
